# A string is called good if it does not contain "010" or "101" as a subsequence  â€” for instance, "1001" contains "101" as a subsequence, hence it is not a good string, while "1000" doesn't contain neither "010" nor "101" as subsequences, so it is a good string.
# What is the minimum number of operations he will have to perform, so that the string becomes good? It can be shown that with these operations we can make any string good.
